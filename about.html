                I spent the majority of my career in auditing and monitoring within clinical research. After reviewing
                so many pages of clinical records I started wondering, <i>how nice it will be to have programs flagging
                  all the anomalies for you?</i> That was the start of my Data Analytics journey.
              </p>
              <p> Now, I enjoy writing code. I feel cool doing it(üôä) and I have fun doing it -when it works. I like
                exploring and learning new skills and technologies to keep my neurons stimulated and to have enough artilery to feel
                confident in my ability to tackle any obstacles in my way. 
                </p>
              <p>
                Having a heavy operations background and immersing myself in tech industry has given me a diverse experience in collaborating with different people 
                in different roles and teams. I have the ability to be very pragmatic and emphatetic when explaining tech concept to a non-tech staff or vise versa. 
              </p>

              <p> I work as hard as I play: I devote my full effort during the working hours, and I will immerse myself in enjoyment and make myself 
                happy outside work. My problem-solving skills also benefits from such framework as I will have a burst of ideas 
                when I have plenty of <i>zen time</i>üçµ‚õ©Ô∏è </p>
